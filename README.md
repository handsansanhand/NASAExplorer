# NASA Visualization Website

This is a website which leverages NASAs free APIs in order to create a space data exploration experience. The project features a React frotend paired with a Node.js and Express backend, and offers offers users interactive access to diverse space data - including NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), recent natural events, earth imagery data, and near-Earth object near-miss information.

## Live Demo
The application is deployed and running live here:

*NOTE: Both the frontend and backend must be running in order for the data fetched from the APIs to work.*

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/handsansanhand/NASAExplorer.git
```


**Frontend**

Go to the forntend directory

```bash
  cd NASAExplorer/frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

**Backend**
Go to the backend directory

```bash
  cd NASAExplorer/backend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```


## Running Tests

You can run tests for both frontend and backend by navigating to either directory.

Then, run:
